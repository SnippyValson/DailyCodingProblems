# Solved it without hints. Sometimes problems can be simplified. Words should be separated by a single space => After
# a sentence starts and if you find a space, the previous character should not be a space. No need to check if you
# found a word ot not. Terminal character should be preceded by a word => just check if the previous character is alpha.
